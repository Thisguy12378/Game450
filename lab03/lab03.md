# Prompt Engineering Process
    The improvement I would like to make is to have in speak like in the medieval times.

    I think that it will improval it because I find stories more engaging if they are spoken like that. Not only that, I feel like it would fit in really well with a Dungeon Master

    The dark theme worked well. I also reduced the tokens to 75.

    I am playing around with some themes to find what would be good for a dungeon master

    Im thinking just the plain dark theme worked better that what I had before
